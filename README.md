## My Undergraduate Research Works

### 🔍 [Improving Sentiment Analysis by Refining NLP Dictionary and Negation Handling](https://github.com/mdyasinahmed)
**Course:** *CSE 422 – Artificial Intelligence Lab*  
**Overview:**  
This research tackled the limitations of lexicon-based sentiment analysis using the AFINN dictionary, specifically its inability to handle complex negations.  
By introducing a **scope-controlled negation handler** and improved tokenization process, we significantly enhanced sentiment accuracy for mixed or ambiguous sentences.  

**My Contributions:**  
- Identified key logical flaws in existing dictionary-based sentiment scoring  
- Redesigned tokenizer to handle negations dynamically  
- Developed improved sentiment scoring logic using JavaScript  
- Proposed next-phase model integration for contextual learning  

**Outcome:**  
Enhanced system accuracy on real-world data and laid groundwork for hybrid ML–NLP models.  

**🛠 Tech Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Preprocessing, JavaScript, NLP Techniques, AFINN Sentiment Lexicon, CNN

### 🧬 [Survival Prediction for Post-HCT Patients Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/mdyasinahmed)
**Course:** *CSE 472 - Machine Learning Lab*  
**Dataset:** *CIBMTR – Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions (Kaggle)*  
**Overview:**  
This study focused on **equitable survival prediction** for Post-Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) patients using machine learning.  
The model integrates both clinical and demographic variables to ensure fairness and transparency in medical outcome prediction.  

**My Contributions:**  
- Designed a machine learning pipeline for survival prediction  
- Conducted feature analysis across 59 variables  
- Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models  
- Interpreted clinical significance of fairness-aware prediction outcomes  

**Outcome:**  
Delivered a fair and interpretable model that supports data-driven, unbiased medical decision-making.  

**🛠 Tech Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Preprocessing, Survival Data Analysis
